abstract: >
  This repository accompanies the paper “Emergent Holonomy from Local Field
  Mismatch,” implementing a self-consistent torsion–holonomy closure on an
  alpha / hexagonal tessellation. The code demonstrates cross-channel
  predictivity between local field mismatch and closed-loop transport, and
  reveals integer-selective resonance in path-ordered SU(2) holonomy
  accumulation without stochastic assumptions or quantum postulates.
